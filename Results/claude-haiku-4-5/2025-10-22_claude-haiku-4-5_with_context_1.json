To remain competitive, companies must leverage this online information efficiently and objectively to guide product development and reduce innovation risks.\n\n[Problem description]\nThe task involves the identification of users who exhibit the distinctive characteristics and behavioral patterns of lead users within online community networks.

      "Prompt": "[Background information]\nEvaluating conceptual design alternatives represents a critical stage in product development, as the selection of suitable conceptual schemes relies heavily on the interpretation of design information. When this evaluation depends primarily on the subjective experience of decision makers, incomplete or ambiguous semantics can arise, leading to gaps in the decision matrix. Although previous approaches attempt to compensate for such missing information using attributes of candidate schemes, they often disregard the potential of external design knowledge sources, such as patents, which limits the objectivity and completeness of the evaluation process.\n\n[Problem description]\nThe relationships between evaluation criteria should be identified.\n\n[Context]\nThe problem statement is analyzed as a single task.\nThe problem \"The relationships between evaluation criteria should be identified\" can be seen as the similar or equal subtask \"Identification of relationships between requirements and stakeholder preferences\".

      "Prompt": "[Background information]\nIn the highly competitive global market, new product development has shifted from a production-oriented to a market-oriented approach. As functional differences between products diminish, customers’ purchasing decisions are increasingly influenced by aesthetic impressions and emotional responses.
