High-technology companies, in particular, depend on lead users to support the development of highly novel products or easily adaptable services. These firms collect large amounts of behavioral and textual data from their online communities, such as posts, replies, and reviews, which reflect users’ expertise, engagement, and opinions. To remain competitive, companies must leverage this online information efficiently and objectively to guide product development and reduce innovation risks.\n\n[Problem description]\nThe task involves the identification of users who exhibit the distinctive characteristics and behavioral patterns of lead users within online community networks. Moreover, these lead users must be grouped according to similarities in their expressed needs, preferences, and perceptions.\n\n[Task description]\nReview the given problem descriptions and name the most appropriate machine learning algorithms for solving it.
