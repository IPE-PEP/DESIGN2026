      "Title": "A patent text-based product conceptual design decision-making approach considering the fusion of incomplete evaluation semantic and scheme beliefs ",
      "Prompt": "[Background information]\nEvaluating conceptual design alternatives represents a critical stage in product development, as the selection of suitable conceptual schemes relies heavily on the interpretation of design information. When this evaluation depends primarily on the subjective experience of decision makers, incomplete or ambiguous semantics can arise, leading to gaps in the decision matrix. Although previous approaches attempt to compensate for such missing information using attributes of candidate schemes, they often disregard the potential of external design knowledge sources, such as patents, which limits the objectivity and completeness of the evaluation process.\n\n[Problem description]\nThe relationships between evaluation criteria should be identified.\n\n[Context]\nThe problem statement is analyzed as a single task.\nThe problem \"The relationships between evaluation criteria should be identified\" can be seen as the similar or equal subtask \"Identification of relationships between requirements and stakeholder preferences\". The subtask \"Identification of relationships between requirements and stakeholder preferences\" can be seen as the following ML-solvable problem: \"Association analysis of sentences to discover rule sets\".\n\n[Task description]\nReview the given problem descriptions and name the most appropriate machine learning algorithms for solving it. The specific machine learning algorithm must be specified.Use the information in [Context].Use the following format:\n\n[Format description]\n  \"ML_problem_type\": \"\",\n  \"ML_algorithm\": \"\"",
      "LLM_Response": "```json\n{\n  \"ML_problem_type\": \"Association Analysis / Rule Mining\",\n  \"ML_algorithm\": \"Apriori Algorithm\"\n}\n```\n\n**Justification:**\n\nGiven the context that identifies the problem as \"Association analysis of sentences to discover rule sets,\" the **Apriori Algorithm** is the most appropriate choice because:\n\n1. **Rule Discovery**: Apriori is specifically designed to discover association rules and relationships between items (in this case, evaluation criteria, requirements, and stakeholder preferences).\n\n2. **Handling Incomplete Data**: It can identify patterns and relationships even when information is sparse or incomplete, which directly addresses the \"gaps in the decision matrix\" mentioned in the background.\n\n3. **Knowledge Extraction**: Apriori can extract meaningful relationships from large datasets (such as patent databases and design knowledge sources) to support objective evaluation.\n\n4. **Interpretability**: The algorithm produces human-readable rules (e.g., \"if criterion A, then criterion B\"), which facilitates decision-maker understanding.\n\n**Alternative consideration**: If the task involves more complex semantic relationships, **Association Rule Learning with Natural Language Processing (NLP)** preprocessing could enhance the solution, but Apriori remains the core ML algorithm for the association analysis component."

      "Title": "Integrating rough set theory and fuzzy association rule mining for product kansei knowledge analysis",
      "Prompt": "[Background information]\nIn the highly competitive global market, new product development has shifted from a production-oriented to a market-oriented approach. As functional differences between products diminish, customers’ purchasing decisions are increasingly influenced by aesthetic impressions and emotional responses. Capturing and translating these emotional needs into tangible design features has become a decisive factor for product success. However, understanding customers’ emotional cognition and linking it to concrete design elements remains challenging due to the vagueness and subjectivity of human perception.\n\n[Problem description]\nThe potential relationships between key emotional attributes (Kansei) and specific product design features must be identified to enable the targeted translation of customer perceptions into product form characteristics.\n\n[Context]\nThe problem statement is analyzed as a single task.\nThe problem \"The potential relationships between key emotional attributes (Kansei) and specific product design features must be identified to enable t...\" can be seen as the similar or equal subtask \"Identification of relationships between product features and their influence on overall customer ratings\". The subtask \"Identification of relationships between product features and their influence on overall customer ratings\" can be seen as the following ML-solvable problem: \"Association analysis of text passages to discover rule sets\".\n\n[Task description]\nReview the given problem descriptions and name the most appropriate machine learning algorithms for solving it.
