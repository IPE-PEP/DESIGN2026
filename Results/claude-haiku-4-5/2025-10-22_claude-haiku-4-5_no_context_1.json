      "Prompt": "[Background information]\nEvaluating conceptual design alternatives represents a critical stage in product development, as the selection of suitable conceptual schemes relies heavily on the interpretation of design information. When this evaluation depends primarily on the subjective experience of decision makers, incomplete or ambiguous semantics can arise, leading to gaps in the decision matrix. Although previous approaches attempt to compensate for such missing information using attributes of candidate schemes, they often disregard the potential of external design knowledge sources, such as patents, which limits the objectivity and completeness of the evaluation process.\n\n[Problem description]\nThe relationships between evaluation criteria should be identified.\n\n[Task description]\nReview the given problem descriptions and name the most appropriate machine learning algorithms for solving it.

      "Prompt": "[Background information]\nIn the highly competitive global market, new product development has shifted from a production-oriented to a market-oriented approach. As functional differences between products diminish, customers’ purchasing decisions are increasingly influenced by aesthetic impressions and emotional responses. Capturing and translating these emotional needs into tangible design features has become a decisive factor for product success. However, understanding customers’ emotional cognition and linking it to concrete design elements remains challenging due to the vagueness and subjectivity of human perception.\n\n[Problem description]\nThe potential relationships between key emotional attributes (Kansei) and specific product design features must be identified to enable the targeted translation of customer perceptions into product form characteristics.\n\n[Task description]\nReview the given problem descriptions and name the most appropriate machine learning algorithms for solving it.
