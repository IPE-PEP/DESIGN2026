      "Prompt": "[Background information]\nEvaluating conceptual design alternatives represents a critical stage in product development, as the selection of suitable conceptual schemes relies heavily on the interpretation of design information. When this evaluation depends primarily on the subjective experience of decision makers, incomplete or ambiguous semantics can arise, leading to gaps in the decision matrix.
