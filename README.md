# Repository for the publication: Graph retrieval-augmented generation for enhancing LLM-based ML algorithm recommendation in product development
## Abstract
Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer substantial potential for product development (PD), yet adoption remains limited. A crucial step is identifying suitable ML algorithms for a given PD problem, which requires translating domain-specific formulations into appropriate ML tasks. Prior work indicates that LLMs struggle with this step due to insufficient domain knowledge. Therefore, this study investigates whether a domain-specific GraphRAG approach improves model performance by enriching prompts with structured context from a PD knowledge graph.

## Repository Content
This repository contains the key artefacts created and used in the publication:
1. **Model configuration (JSON)**
2. **Knowledge graph documentation (JSON)**
3. **Evaluation dataset (JSON)**
4. **Results (JSON)**

### Model configuration (JSON)
Contains the decoding parameters, system settings, and LLM configurations used in all experimental conditions.

### Knowledge graph documentation (JSON) 
Provides the exported structure and size of the domain-specific knowledge graph, including phases, activities, methods, design tasks, subtasks, and atomic ML tasks.

### Evaluation dataset (JSON)
The dataset used for evaluating the large language models consists of two key elements: 
- **Product development-related problem formulations** extracted from the identified publications
- **Machine learning algorithms** applied to address these product development-related problems in the publications
Currently, the dataset comprises 56 problem formulations along with their corresponding applied machine learning algorithms.

### Results (JSON)
Contains folders with the prompts and corresponding responses generated by the evaluated LLMs in the baseline setting (no_context) and using the GraphRAG-based approach (with_context).
